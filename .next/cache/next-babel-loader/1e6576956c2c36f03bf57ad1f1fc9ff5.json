This awareness has allowed me to enhance customer service, steer production, and provide an environment that puts clients and teammates at ease. This awareness, along with my diverse background, makes me a better programmer. Of course, I geek out over whiteboards, problem-solving, strategizing, and well-organized budget projections.
